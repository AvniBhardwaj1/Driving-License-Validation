This web application is designed to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for driving license validation. It was built using AngularJS and Node.js, with MySQL as the database.

## Features

- **Welcome Page**: Users are greeted with a welcome page (`welcome.html`) upon visiting the application.
- **Main Page**: After the welcome page, users are directed to the main page (`main.html`) where they can perform various operations.
- **Form Submission**: The application allows users to submit data related to driving license validation via a form (`submit.html`).
- **CRUD Operations**: CRUD operations are implemented to manage driving license data effectively.
- **Styling**: CSS files (`style.css`, `submit.css`, `welcome style.css`) are provided for styling the web pages and form elements.
- **Server-Side Logic**: Server-side logic is implemented using Node.js in `server.js`, handling requests and interacting with the database.
- **Client-Side Logic**: AngularJS is used for client-side logic, with controllers defined in `welcomecontroller.js`.
- **Database**: MySQL is used as the database to store driving license data.
- **Academic Project**: This project was a part of the final project submission for the 3rd semester Web Programming subject.
